# TheMoviesApp: MVVM-R and Clean Architecture

TheMoviesApp is a small Swift app designed to apply the best of MVVM and Clean architectures.

When looking for some MVVM tips and guidelines online, most of the times you will find good examples for the Presentation layer, but usually coupled with API calls directly on the ViewModel and a total lack of interfacing in order to decouple the layers and make Unit Testing viable.

This project combines Clean Architecture in order to apply the SOLID Principles with the recommended MVVM pattern for the Presentation layer.
